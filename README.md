Lab8, it uses two fragments, BookList and BookDetails. I added Filterable to the book_adapter so the user can search for a book.
.getFilter has some problems and doesn't always return the correct book. The book the user selects stays selected when the phone
is in Landscape, but sometimes crashes the phone. (note that could be because my computer is having problems it kept forcing 
android studio to close.) Same thing with the bookList.
